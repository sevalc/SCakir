For this project, I created a portfolio using html and CSS for myself. 

In this project, I focused on using Flex containers to create a dynamic/adaptive layout of components. I tried to exercise using various nested flex containers to solidfy my understanding of sizing, layout direction, wrapping and positioning of elements in flex.
